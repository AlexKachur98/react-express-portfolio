# Alex Kachur • Portfolio

Modern MERN-based personal site showcasing my work, background, and contact touchpoints. The frontend is a glassmorphism-inspired single-page experience with animated sections, while the backend exposes authenticated CRUD APIs with admin tooling. **Release v3.0.0** adds sign-in/sign-up flows, an admin dashboard/CMS, a user guest book, API-backed cat gallery uploads, and hardened deployment defaults.

This repo now embraces a _sections-first_ approach: the React app renders every view inside `Home.jsx`, and the floating navigation drives smooth anchor scrolling from desktop down to tablet and mobile breakpoints.

## ✨ Highlights

- **Admin Dashboard (NEW)** – `/admin` lets me manage education, projects, services, gallery images, contact submissions, users, and guest book signatures with JWT + httpOnly cookies.
- **Guest Book + Accounts** – Visitors can sign up/sign in (including a secret hero CTA) to leave, edit, or remove notes; admins can moderate entries.
- **API-Driven Cat Gallery** – `/cats` now pulls from Mongo-backed uploads with tags, favourites, filters, keyboard-friendly full-screen viewing, and API caching safety.
- **Self-Hosted Visuals** – Three.js + Vanta Waves ship locally (no CDN) to satisfy stricter CSP/deployment needs while keeping the animated glass aesthetic.
- **Hardened Backend** – CORS allowlist, secure-cookie support behind proxies, rate-limited contact submissions, admin seeding utilities, and SPA-friendly static serving.

## 🔧 Getting Started

```bash
# Install all workspace dependencies
npm install

# Launch backend (nodemon + babel-node) and frontend (Vite) together
npm run dev

# Backend only (useful for API testing)
npm run server

# Frontend only
npm run client
```

- App runs at `http://localhost:5173` (frontend) and `http://localhost:3000` (API).
- Create a `.env` alongside `package.json` with at least:

```bash
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/MyPortfolioDB
JWT_SECRET=replace-me-with-a-strong-secret
CLIENT_ORIGINS=http://localhost:5173,http://localhost:3000
COOKIE_SECURE=false             # set true in production/HTTPS
ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@alex-portfolio.local
ADMIN_PASSWORD=ChangeMe123!     # override for production
```

An admin user is auto-seeded on boot via `ADMIN_EMAIL`/`ADMIN_PASSWORD`. In production, set `CLIENT_ORIGINS` and `COOKIE_SECURE=true` so cookies stay scoped correctly.

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build:client  # Generates Vite production bundle under client/dist
npm start             # Serves built frontend + API via Express
```

## 🆕 What’s New in v3.0.0

- Full admin dashboard with JWT + httpOnly cookies to manage users, education, projects, services, gallery uploads, contact submissions, and guest book entries.
- Public sign-up/sign-in flows (plus a “secret” hero CTA) that route admins to `/admin` and guests to the `/guestbook`.
- Guest book experience with per-user updates/deletes and admin moderation.
- Cat Gallery now backed by MongoDB/API uploads (tags, filters, favourites, keyboardable modal, safer caching).
- Self-hosted Vanta/Three assets and tightened server config (CORS allowlist, secure cookies, rate-limited contact endpoint, trust proxy).

---

## 🧪 Testing & Quality

```bash
npm test          # Run all Jest test suites (99 tests)
npm run lint      # ESLint check
```

**Test Coverage:**

- CRUD factory validation and error handling
- Form validators (email, password, required fields)
- Input sanitization and XSS prevention
- Security middleware (rate limiting, cookie settings)
- API validation rules

**Manual Checks:**

- Run `npm run dev` and confirm anchors, reveals, and the Vanta background load without console errors.
- Create a user via `/signup`, sign in, sign the guest book, and update/delete your note; verify admin moderation on `/admin/guestbook`.
- Use an admin account to CRUD education/projects/services/gallery items and see them reflected on `/` and `/cats`.
- Submit the contact form and ensure rate limiting responds gracefully if spammed.
- Inspect Lighthouse performance/responsiveness across mobile/desktop.

---

## 🚀 Deployment Notes

- Build the frontend (`npm run build:client` or `npm run gcp-build`) before deploying to services like Render, Railway, or VPS.
- Set environment variables (`NODE_ENV`, `MONGO_URI`, `JWT_SECRET`, `CLIENT_ORIGINS`, `ADMIN_EMAIL`, `ADMIN_PASSWORD`, `COOKIE_SECURE`) in your hosting platform.
- Express already serves `client/dist` with cache headers; ensure HTTPS so secure cookies work in production.
